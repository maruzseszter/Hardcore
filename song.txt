been lookin' for a substitution
(Ooh) healin' my heart's confusion
(Ooh) been lookin' for a substitution
But there ain't no one replacin' you
Am I high or low? Am I bipolar?
Need another you to shake it, shake it
Oh, I love that face, perfect stranger
'Cause I could use someone to shake it, shake it

And I know that I can't get you outta my head
And I know I can't numb you away
Yeah, I know when I wake up with her instead
No, there ain't no one replacin' you
No, there ain't no one replacin' you

Gotta loosen up my emotions
Just started up to shake it, shake it
When I hear your name, I can't be sober
I could use someone to shake it, shake it
